Version 1.51
 
This is a shell replacement program for Windows 3.1x and Win-OS/2 which
provides users with a user interface similar to OS/2 Warp's Workplace Shell.
 
The shell can start applications, switch between them, organize applications
and documents in folders, organize folders on the desktop, move, copy and
delete folders and documents, change color schemes of your folders and
much more.
 
Workplace Shell for Windows is modeled after the object-oriented Workplace
Shell which is an integral part of the award-winning OS/2 Warp, designed
by IBM. While it does not approach the real OS/2 Workplace Shell in the
richness of its features, it can serve as an introduction to the real one
for a user not familiar with the OS/2 as well as provide a consistent and
familiar user interface for the OS/2 users who occasionally use Windows
applications.

File Phoenix will scan a selected drive and list all files
which are (possibly) recoverable. You can then select one or
more files and recover them to another drive.
 
File Phoenix also allows you to:
 
     1) View the first 4096 bytes of a file before
        recovering it.
     2) View each cluster of an erased FAT file and
        decide whether you want to recover it or skip
        it.  This is especially useful when recovering
        files who's clusters were not contiguous.
     3) Search the free space on a FAT drive for text and
        start recovering data from where the text was found.
 
Both HPFS and FAT drives are supported.
 
Use the right mouse button to display the context menu.
You can do this with the mouse over the main window or over
a file in the list of recoverable files.
 
Startup parameters:  -r  - does not use the saved window
                           position and size from the
                           previous invocation.  This is
                           useful if you change the
                           resolution for your monitor.
 
What's new in release 1.20:
 
     1) On-line help (finally!)
     2) FastScan for HPFS
     3) Search free space on a FAT drive for text
     4) Skip backward in prompted recovery

Group Folder
 
  To handle the problem of getting to an object in a folder, many
  users create a special folder to hold objects that they frequently
  use.  But often this new folder becomes filled with objects, some
  of which are only used once a month while others are used hourly.
  Locating a desired object in such a folder can be like trying to
  find "a needle in a haystack".
 
  To solve the retrieval problem, Group Folder allows you to create
  visible subsections within a given folder.  Thus, you have more
  control over the organization of the contents of folders.  The
  grouping of related objects helps you locate the object you want
  more quickly.

Version 1.00
 
Author: Brian Yoder
 
 This package contains a set of command-line utilities. Each is
 available for OS/2 2.X and DOS.
 
 The OS/2 versions are more capable then their DOS counterparts
 (including support for HPFS long filenames and for extended
 attributes). However, users with systems that are configured for
 dual boot will find it convenient to have these commands
 available whether booting OS/2 or native DOS. In addition, the
 native DOS versions will run within an OS/2 windowed or
 full-screen DOS session, though with reduced function as
 compared to their OS/2 counterparts.

Progref is a pm utility to quickly generate Program reference objects from
executables. The program program accepts as input 0 or more fully
defined program names (ie the path is included) separated by blanks.
For example "progref d:\abcd\test.exe f:\zyz\next.cmd".  If no argument is
supplied a file dialog provides for selection of the input file.
Alternatly, selecting executables from the drives object and dropping them on
a program reference of progref itself will provide the same input.  A simple
one panel dialog will allow the user to select the parameters described below.
The program reference objects will be put on the desktop, where they can be
dropped into the folders of your choice. The repeat button will produce
a program reference object and leave the dialog box in place.  This is
handy if you want to make multiple copies with minor changes.

EPMPLX  Version 2.2
 
EPM PL/x Coding Assist (EPMPLx) is a set of EPM key definitions and
command macros that attempts to improve programmer productivity (and
decrease frustration) while writing PL/1 type code.
EPMPLx eases the task of coding in the following ways:
 
   * Structure expansion - PL/AS structures such as IF, ELSE, DO,
   BEGIN, PROCEDURE, GENERATE, SELECT, and WHEN are automatically
   expanded.  You just enter the structure keyword and the entire
   structure is placed into the file.
   * Automatic remark placement - Remarks are automatically started in
   the column you select.
   * Automatic and controlled remark formatting - When entering
   remarks the text of the remark is automatically formatted to stay
   within set columns.  Remarks can also be reformatted at your
   request.  The starting and ending columns can be changed at any
   time.
   * Automatic flagging - You can have 4 or 8 character change flags
   automatically placed into your remarks.
   * Case control -
   -  Text entered as code can be forced to uppercase, swapped, or asis.
   -  Keywords can be upper, lower, or mixed case.
   * Controlled code insertion and deletion - When code is inserted or
   deleted on a line containing a remark, the remark is not moved.
   * Remark reformatting - The text of a remark can be reformatted at
   the touch of a key.
   * Auto indent - When a new line is inserted, the cursor is placed
   in the line and column in which you probably want to enter new
   code.
   * Block comment insertion and editing - When adding new or editing
   old block comments, you can enter the text of the comment without
   worrying about the block comment delimiters.

descriptive.  The LTRENAME utility allows you to change this Title Text to
any valid ASCII string.  This allows you to more easily identify your LT
sessions, especially when the are minimized.  The new Text string can be as
simple as the Host Name, or as complicated as you need.

* Would you like to use the C standard function 'printf' in your PM
  programs for debugging, occasional error messages, etc.?
 
* Do you have existing subroutines, that use printf, that you'd like to
  use in PM programs?
 
If you answer yes to either of these, you may find the PMprintf tool
useful.  PMprintf comprises two parts:
 
  printf.obj -- an object file, compiled with IBM C Set/2, which you
    link in with your PM program just like any other subroutine.  This
    provides the printf service to that program.  You write printf calls
    in your C program in the usual way; the printf subroutine buffers
    the data (on a per-thread basis in multi-thread programs) and adds
    each completed line to a message queue.  For example, the following
    printf call will write a line to the PMprintf application and sound
    the Alert (bell):
 
      printf("This seems to work\a\n");
 
    Sample source (in C) is also provided for the printf function.
 
  pmprintf.exe -- is a PM application which sets up the queue used by
    printf and then "catches" and displays incoming printf lines.  It is
    a kind of 'monitor' or 'virtual console' which will accept lines
    from any number of processes that use printf.  PMprintf offers a
    number of options, including the ability to log the incoming lines
    to a file.  See below for a short description of the options.
 
    If PMprintf has been started then it will display the incoming lines
    from printf calls in other processes.  If it has not been started,
    then printf calls are quietly ignored (they return 0, not an error).
    PMprintf can be started or stopped at any time, and printf calls
    will then become active or be ignored as appropriate.
 
Sample source for printf (printf.c) is included in the package; this
offers certain customization options (for example, you can cause a
prefix to be added to the start of each line so that different
applications can have unique output lines, or cause lines to be broken
at a certain length). There are also some usage hints and minor
restrictions, documented in the header of printf.c.

PMGlobe is a program which displays the Earth as a globe using OS/2
Presentation Manager.  You can choose to view the globe from any
direction, or select one of a number of 'standard' views.
 
In addition to simply displaying a picture of the world, PMGlobe will
also let you light the globe as though by sunlight -- so you can see
at a glance those areas of the globe where the sun has risen, and where
it is night.  Additional options add shading to the globe for a
three-dimensional effect, and let you measure distances between
two points on the globe.  Other features are described in the file
PMGLOBE.DOC.
 
With the command interface included with PMGlobe, you can add markers
and labels to the globe and have greater control over its actions.  If
you wish, you can use REXX (the scripting language included with OS/2)
as a macro language for PMGlobe -- see PMGLOBEX.DOC for a description of
the PMGlobe commands available; all of them can be used in a REXX macro.
 
Ver 2.02 fixes a problem with DOS programs (even COMM ones) and adds
         on-globe clock capability.

Group Folder
 
  To handle the problem of getting to an object in a folder, many
  users create a special folder to hold objects that they frequently
  use.  But often this new folder becomes filled with objects, some
  of which are only used once a month while others are used hourly.
  Locating a desired object in such a folder can be like trying to
  find "a needle in a haystack".
 
  To solve the retrieval problem, Group Folder allows you to create
  visible subsections within a given folder.  Thus, you have more
  control over the organization of the contents of folders.  The
  grouping of related objects helps you locate the object you want
  more quickly.

EDTINI.ZIP                Date Issued - October 3, 1992
Author: Gunnar P. Seaburg IBM Houston Texas.
 
The EDITINI program is a simple editor which can be used to view
and change text entries in the OS2.INI and OS2SYS.INI keyed
files.  The OS2.INI and OS2SYS.INI files provide a convenient
place for programs to store profile information.  However, these
files are stored in binary form and therefore cannot be readily
viewed without a special program.  That's why EDITINI was
created.
 
EDITINI can be used to view text entries in the OS2.INI and
OS2SYS.INI profiles, and it also provides the ability to change
or delete entries if desired.  (EDITINI does not provide binary
data editing capability.)

HEXDMP.ZIP                Date Issued - September 1, 1992
Author: Joe Nord          IBM Boca Raton, FL.
 
A binary data display and conversion utility, hexdump supports both bin2hex
and hex2bin functionality.  'bin2hex' is pretty self-explainatory.
For 'hex2bin' (-r), hexdump searches the input stream for "nibbles"
converting each pair to a binary output byte.  To facilitate small changes
to binary files, input hex format is compatible with hexdump displayed hex and
characters following a '*' on a line are ignored (for comments).

  REMOTE PASSWORD ADMINISTRATION UTILITY
  For Client-to-Server-to-Host Password Updates
 
  This is for EXTENDED SERVICES 1.0 (ES 1.0)
 
  PURPOSE:  This utility is intended for use with the OS/2 Database
            Manager, while running a Server and Client(s) arrangement
            without the use of the OS/2 LAN Server program.
 
            The problem to be solved is: how does a user on a client
            machine update the password access on the server, for
            a particular user-id.  In addition, if a host session(s)
            is provided and active on the server, how does a user on a
            client machine update the password access on the host
            session(s). The problem is physical access to the
            server is very difficult or virtually impossible, due to
            distance or security access.
 
            This utility allows a user on a client machine to update
            the password access on the server, for a particular
            user-id.  In addition, if a host session(s) is provided
            and active on the server, this utility allows a user on a
            client machine to update the password access on the host
            session(s), all without having physical access to the server.
