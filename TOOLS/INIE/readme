How to get currently open profiles to appear in the Open File dialog
--------------------------------------------------------------------

If you are running a version of OS/2 which is 2.11 or later you will
notice that OS2.INI and OS2SYS.INI do not appear in the open file dialog
of INIE when you switch to the OS2 directory of your boot drive. This is
because OS/2 versions 2.11 and later turn on the SYSTEM file
attribute of profiles when they are open and the standard OS/2 file
dialog does not find SYSTEM files in its search.  OS2.INI and OS2SYS.INI
are always open when OS/2 is running thus they are marked as SYSTEM and
are not found.

In the past I have shipped patched versions of PMCTLS.DLL in the INIE
package.  PMCTLS.DLL is the DLL where the standard file dialog box
lives.  The patch involved changing the attribute byte in the parameters
of the search to include SYSTEM files.  There are more versions of OS/2
floating around now, so instead of shipping a PMCTLS.DLL for every one,
I am now just going to tell you how to use PATCH to make your own
patched version.


OS/2 version        filesize      offset       change from   change to
-----------------   --------   -------------   -----------   ---------
2.11                  330651       46BE7           10           14
Warp 3.0*             432772       5D34A           10           14
Warp Connect 3.0      432772       5D34A           10           14
Warp + FixPak 9       433494       5D7F1           10           14


* Note: Warp 3.0 means both plain and "with WIN-OS2" versions


First, PMCTLS.DLL is a locked file so you just can't change it on the
fly.  Copy PMCTLS.DLL to PMCTLS.NEW and run patch on the new file by
typing the following:
and typing:

CD \OS2\DLL
COPY PMCTLS.DLL PMCTLS.NEW
PATCH PMCTLS.NEW

Use the table above to figure out at which offset to make the change.
Type in your change and hit enter.  PATCH will then ask if you want
to continue patching and you should answer N.  Then it will ask if
you want to write your changes to which you should answer Y.

The easiest way to replace the DLL with the new patched one is to use
REPMOD which is also available from OS2TOOLS.  REPMOD will copy the new
file over the old, so you might want to save a backup copy of the
original.  In the OS2\DLL directory just type:

COPY PMCTLS.DLL PMCTLS.BAK
REPMOD PMCTLS.NEW PMCTLS

Then reboot and you will see system files in your Open File dialogs.
