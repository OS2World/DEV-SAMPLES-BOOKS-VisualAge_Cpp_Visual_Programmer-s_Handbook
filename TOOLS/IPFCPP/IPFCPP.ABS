IPFC Preprocessor is tool to expand the capabilities of the IPF Compiler.  It 
provides additional function for the IPF Compiler that are necessary for both
single sourcing online documentation & hardcopy books (using BookMaster), and 
single sourcing of symbols for the developer and help panel writer.  IPFC 
Preprocessor allows you to define symbols, create conditionally compiled 
sections of documents, include C language symbols (using #define) in help 
panels, create simple text macros (tags), and resolves searches for imbedded 
files and bitmaps to other directories.
